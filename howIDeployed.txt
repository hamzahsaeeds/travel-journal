I simply first downloaded my scrim's code from Scrimba.
Then I opened it in VS Code and ran these two commands:
npm install
npm run build

I think this file called index.pack.js was created or at least updated as a result of executing the second command

Then I used the 'deploy manually' option on Netlify and uploaded the entire folder there.

And voila it worked!
